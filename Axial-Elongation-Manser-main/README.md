# Axial-Elongation-Manser

Code written as part of my master's project work and subsequent internship with the Steventon Lab at Cambridge and the Verd Lab at Oxford.

The work is divided up into 3 sections: Creating Frames, Running Simulations and Visualising Simulations. Each section has it's own readme file.
The general approach is:
  1) First create the frames of the animation (done on personal computer). This only needs to be done once for each new somite stage, i.e you can run as many simulations off the same frames as you like.
  2) Run the simulation (generally on a supercomputer, but can be done locally).
  3) Download the output files of the simulation, and use my code in the'visualising simulations' section to animate the cell tracks.
