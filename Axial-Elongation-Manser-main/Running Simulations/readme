RUNNING SIMULATIONS

This was done remotely on Porcupine using Jupyter notebooks. Porcupine is a supercomputer in the Steventon Lab.

The file organisation is as follows:
-Running Simulations
  -main.py
  -Frames
    -17_18_0.npy
    -17_18_10.npy
    -17_18_20.npy
    ....
    -17_18_100.npy
    -17S_RF_PSM_Detailed.csv

To run the simulations, the Frames file must be unzipped as shown above. In this repository it is zipped to save storage.
The numpy files store the border shape for each time step (0 to 100 in steps of 10 each).
17S_RF_PSM_Detailed.csv gives the starting position of each cells as observed by Lewis Thomson.

Once main.py has finished running, it will output a zipped file saves.zip. This contains (for each simulation run in main.py) the files tracks_frame_0_0.csv, tracks_x_0_0.csv, tracks_y_0_0.csv and tracks_z_0_0.csv. tracks_frame_0_0.csv says when the frame was changed and tracks_x_0_0.csv gives the x coordinates of each cell for each timestep. Same for tracks_y_0_0.csv and tracks_z_0_0.csv. I've included an example saves.zip file here.
